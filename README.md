# Crustacean Conglomerate ETools Data Management System
This project was created for academic purposes only. The files in this repository were cloned from an existing repository- I was not responsible for the creation of all files.

You can run this program by installing the .bacpac file into SQL Server Management Studio. You can open the project in Visuaol Studio through the solution file. Add the database connection to your user secrets or app_settings.json file in the project and run the project in your web browser.

This project was a group effort. I was fully responsible for the home page, navigation bar layout, and the purchase orders webpage.
