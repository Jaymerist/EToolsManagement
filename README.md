# Crustacean Conglomerate ETools Data Management System
This project was created for academic purposes only. 

You can run this program by installing the .bacpac file into SQL Server Management Studio. Add the database connection to your user secrets or app_settings.json file in the project. 

This project was a group effort. I was fully responsible for the home page, navigation bar layout, and the purchase orders webpage.
